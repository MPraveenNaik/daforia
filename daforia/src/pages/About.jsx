          The idea for Daforia was born from watching my mother struggle with her tea habit despite doctor's warnings, and later experiencing similar issues myself. When she occasionally switched to coffee, she would lose sleep - a problem I recognized all too well during my time as a software developer at Microland.

        <StoryParagraph>
          Drinking black coffee to power through long coding sessions, I found myself lying awake night after night, victim to caffeine's lingering effects. I noticed this pattern everywhere - people reaching for coffee or tea not because they wanted to, but because there were no better alternatives for that <Highlight>much-needed sip of relaxation</Highlight> during work sessions.
        </StoryParagraph>
        
        <StoryParagraph>
          These conventional options came with unwanted side effects: sleeplessness, lost appetite, and dependency. My search for a balanced alternative led me to date seed coffee - a revelation that could provide <Highlight>genuine relaxation without compromising health or natural rhythms</Highlight>.
        </StoryParagraph>
        
        <StoryParagraph>
          Daforia was created to solve this very real problem - to offer that comforting ritual of a warm drink without the negative consequences. It's the <Highlight>sustainable, healthy alternative</Highlight> we all deserved but didn't have.
